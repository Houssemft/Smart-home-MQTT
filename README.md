# Smart-home-MQTT
This repository demonstrates a **Smart Home system** using the **MQTT protocol**. The project simulates the communication between smart home devices and a central controller, showcasing the efficiency and scalability of MQTT in IoT systems.

## Features

- **MQTT Communication**: Utilizes the MQTT protocol for lightweight and reliable communication between devices.
- **Device Simulation**: Includes virtual devices like sensors and actuators to emulate a smart home setup.
- **Centralized Control**: A hub that collects data and sends commands to devices.
- **Expandability**: Easily extendable to add more devices or functions.

## Project Structure

- **MQTT Broker**: Manages the communication between devices.
- **Devices**: Simulated components like temperature sensors, light switches, and smart thermostats.
- **Controller**: Central logic to process device data and send commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Ensure Cisco Packet Tracer is installed.
